You know that classic “Hello, World” moment every programmer has? The one where you stare at your terminal, whisper a little prayer to the compiler gods, and hope something — anything — actually prints?
Yeah, this is *that*, but for my blog.

So… hello, world. 👋

I finally decided to start writing stuff here — probably thoughts, experiments, and the occasional ramble about code, design, or whatever random brainwave hits me at 3 a.m.

I can’t promise everything here will make sense. In fact, some of it definitely won’t. But I *can* promise it’ll be real — curious, slightly unhinged, but full of heart.

Maybe this becomes a digital journal of little victories. Maybe it’s a documentation of “what not to do” when building cool things. Either way, it’s starting now.

So pull up a chair, grab a snack, and let’s see where this goes.
Welcome to the chaos.
