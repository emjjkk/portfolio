    "excerpt": "Tired of Spotify paywalls and sketchy download sites, I built a lightweight YouTube downloader using Flask, yt-dlp, and a pinch of JS. You can search videos or paste links, see thumbnails and details, and download audio (MP3) or video (MP4) locally. Minimal setup: Python + a few HTML/CSS/JS files, all running on your machine. Hosting on a server is tricky due to YouTube restrictions, but you can run it locally with a helper script for instant access. Respect creators and keep it personal-use only.",

It’s an easy way to make your portfolio feel alive and show what you’re up to in real time.",
